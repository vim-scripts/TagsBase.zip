Tags Base started as the merge and enhancements of the scripts:
 *TagsMenu (http://members.home.net/jayglanville/tagsmenu/TagsMenu.html) script
 		    Jay Dickon Glanville  dickon@nortelnetworks.com

 *ctags.vim (http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=12) script
 			Alexey Marinichev   lyosha@lyosha.2y.net
 see |TagsBase-Credits|
It now is a complete rewrite of those scripts plus additional functionality in embedded
perl as well as some of the original vim code which is used to provide the same functionality
when you are unlucky enough not to have access to the +perl or +perl/dyn feature in
your vim build.

Tags Base automatically uses |ctags| to generate a |tag| file for the currently
edited file, refreshes it if the file is newer than the tags file and uses it
to provide a set of advanced feature to vim.

Beware that this means that some tag files are left behind on your computer,
	they may end up in the same directory as your files or in a temporary
	directory depending on the rights of the file directory. You can specify the
	prefixe and suffix used to compute those temporary files.  There is also
                some options to cleanup those file, the default being of only cleaning up
                the temp directory.

Right now the feature provided are:
    *Detection of the currently edited tag and its type and presentation of this information in the
     title bar. Most of the time when editing a C/C++/java... file this means you have on the 
     title bar the name of the current function.     *Creation of a menu of tags in the file this 
     contains things such as method, function, class... the type of tags supported depends on 
     the current language and on the implementation of the |ctags| program

    TagsBase manipulates all tags supported by |ctags|. (For the full list of
    supported tags and attributes, see "http://ctags.sourceforge.net/&quot;


Additional description can be found in the included help file. This script requires a version 5.0 of ctags.

This script has also been used by me as a test bed for embedding perl in vim scripts specifically for
performance reasons since parsing a large set of tags can take a fair amount of time.
For this reason you'll find a couple fo files (TagsBase.pl and VIM.pm) which I use in the development
process, to find out about this see vimtip #140
